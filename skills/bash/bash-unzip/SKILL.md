    # Command: `unzip`

    ## Overview

    Extract zip archives.

    ## When to use

    Use `unzip` when your task matches what it does best (see Overview). In a
    script, prefer it over hand-rolled logic — these tools are battle-tested,
    fast, and composable through pipes.

    ## Worked examples

    ```bash
unzip out.zip
```
```bash
unzip -l out.zip
```

    ## Structuring it in a program

    `unzip` is a building block in a shell pipeline. Compose it with `|`, guard on
    its **exit code**, and quote your variables:

    ```bash
    set -euo pipefail
    if unzip ... ; then
        echo "ok"
    else
        echo "unzip failed with exit $?" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

    - Chain with `|` to pass output to the next stage.
    - Check `$?` (or use `set -e`) — a non-zero exit means failure.
    - Quote `"$variables"` to survive spaces and globs.

Usage: unzip [-Z] [-opts[modifiers]] file[.zip] [list] [-x xlist] [-d exdir]
  Default action is to extract files in list, except those in xlist, to exdir;
  file[.zip] may be a wildcard.  -Z => ZipInfo mode ("unzip -Z" for usage).

  -p  extract files to pipe, no messages     -l  list files (short format)
  -f  freshen existing files, create none    -t  test compressed archive data
  -u  update files, create if necessary      -z  display archive comment only
  -v  list verbosely/show version info       -T  timestamp archive to latest
  -x  exclude files that follow (in xlist)   -d  extract files into exdir
modifiers:
  -n  never overwrite existing files         -q  quiet mode (-qq => quieter)
  -o  overwrite files WITHOUT prompting      -a  auto-convert any text files
  -j  junk paths (do not make directories)   -aa treat ALL files as text
  -U  use escapes for all non-ASCII Unicode  -UU ignore any Unicode fields
  -C  match filenames case-insensitively     -L  make (some) names lowercase
  -X  restore UID/GID info                   -V  retain VMS version numbers
  -K  keep setuid/setgid/tacky permissions   -M  pipe through "more" pager
See "unzip -hh" or unzip.txt for more help.  Examples:
  unzip data1 -x joe   => extract all files except joe from zipfile data1.zip
  unzip -p foo | more  => send contents of foo.zip via pipe into program more
  unzip -fo foo ReadMe => quietly replace existing ReadMe if archive file newer
```
