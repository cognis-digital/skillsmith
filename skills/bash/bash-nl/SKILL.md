    # Command: `nl`

    ## Overview

    Number the lines of a file.

    ## When to use

    Use `nl` when your task matches what it does best (see Overview). In a
    script, prefer it over hand-rolled logic — these tools are battle-tested,
    fast, and composable through pipes.

    ## Worked examples

    ```bash
nl file
```
```bash
nl -ba script.sh
```

    ## Structuring it in a program

    `nl` is a building block in a shell pipeline. Compose it with `|`, guard on
    its **exit code**, and quote your variables:

    ```bash
    set -euo pipefail
    if nl ... ; then
        echo "ok"
    else
        echo "nl failed with exit $?" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

    - Chain with `|` to pass output to the next stage.
    - Check `$?` (or use `set -e`) — a non-zero exit means failure.
    - Quote `"$variables"` to survive spaces and globs.

Usage: nl [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Write each FILE to standard output, with line numbers added.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -b, --body-numbering=STYLE      use STYLE for numbering body lines
  -d, --section-delimiter=CC      use CC for logical page delimiters
  -f, --footer-numbering=STYLE    use STYLE for numbering footer lines
  -h, --header-numbering=STYLE    use STYLE for numbering header lines
  -i, --line-increment=NUMBER     line number increment at each line
  -l, --join-blank-lines=NUMBER   group of NUMBER empty lines counted as one
  -n, --number-format=FORMAT      insert line numbers according to FORMAT
  -p, --no-renumber               do not reset line numbers for each section
  -s, --number-separator=STRING   add STRING after (possible) line number
  -v, --starting-line-number=NUMBER  first line number for each section
  -w, --number-width=NUMBER       use NUMBER columns for line numbers
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

Default options are: -bt -d'\:' -fn -hn -i1 -l1 -n'rn' -s<TAB> -v1 -w6

CC are two delimiter characters used to construct logical page delimiters;
a missing second character implies ':'.

STYLE is one of:

  a      number all lines
  t      number only nonempty lines
  n      number no lines
  pBRE   number only lines that contain a match for the basic regular
         expression, BRE

FORMAT is one of:

  ln     left justified, no leading zeros
  rn     right justified, no leading zeros
  rz     right justified, leading zeros
