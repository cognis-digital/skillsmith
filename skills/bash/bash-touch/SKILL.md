    # Command: `touch`

    ## Overview

    Create empty files or update timestamps.

    ## When to use

    Use `touch` when your task matches what it does best (see Overview). In a
    script, prefer it over hand-rolled logic — these tools are battle-tested,
    fast, and composable through pipes.

    ## Worked examples

    ```bash
touch newfile
```
```bash
touch -t 202601010000 f
```

    ## Structuring it in a program

    `touch` is a building block in a shell pipeline. Compose it with `|`, guard on
    its **exit code**, and quote your variables:

    ```bash
    set -euo pipefail
    if touch ... ; then
        echo "ok"
    else
        echo "touch failed with exit $?" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

    - Chain with `|` to pass output to the next stage.
    - Check `$?` (or use `set -e`) — a non-zero exit means failure.
    - Quote `"$variables"` to survive spaces and globs.

Usage: touch [OPTION]... FILE...
Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h
is supplied.

A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch to
change the times of the file associated with standard output.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a                     change only the access time
  -c, --no-create        do not create any files
  -d, --date=STRING      parse STRING and use it instead of current time
  -f                     (ignored)
  -h, --no-dereference   affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced
                         file (useful only on systems that can change the
                         timestamps of a symlink)
  -m                     change only the modification time
  -r, --reference=FILE   use this file's times instead of current time
  -t STAMP               use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time
      --time=WORD        change the specified time:
                           WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a
                           WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.
