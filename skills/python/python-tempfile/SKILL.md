# Python: `tempfile`

## Overview

Temporary files.

This module provides generic, low- and high-level interfaces for
creating temporary files and directories.  All of the interfaces
provided by this module can be used without fear of race conditions
except for 'mktemp'.  'mktemp' is subject to race conditions and
should not be used; it is provided for backward compatibility only.

The default path names are returned as str.  If you supply bytes as
input, all return values will be in bytes.  Ex:

    >>> tempfile.mkstemp()
    (4, '/tmp/tmptpu9nin8')
    >>> tempfile.mkdtemp(suffix=b'')
    b'/tmp/tmppbi8f0hy'

This module also provides some data items to the user:

  TMP_MAX  - maximum number of names that will be tried before
             giving up.
  tempdir  - If this is set to a string before the first use of
             any routine from this module, it will be considered as
             another candidate location to store temporary files.

## When to use

Reach for `tempfile` when your task calls for Temporary files. It ships with Python — no dependency to install, available on every interpreter.

## Import

```python
import tempfile
```

## Key functions

- `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+b', buffering=-1, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, delete=True, *, errors=None, delete_on_close=True)`
- `tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='w+b', buffering=-1, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, delete=True, *, errors=None, delete_on_close=True)`
- `tempfile.gettempdir()`
- `tempfile.gettempdirb()`
- `tempfile.gettempprefix()`
- `tempfile.gettempprefixb()`
- `tempfile.mkdtemp(suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None)`
- `tempfile.mkstemp(suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, text=False)`
- `tempfile.mktemp(suffix='', prefix='tmp', dir=None)`

## Key classes

`SpooledTemporaryFile`, `TemporaryDirectory`

## Constants / attributes

`TMP_MAX`, `tempdir`, `template`

## Structuring it in a program

Import once at the top of the module, then call into it where you need it. A
robust pattern wraps the call, handles the errors the module can raise, and
keeps the interface small:

```python
import tempfile

def do_work(...):
    """Use tempfile to accomplish one well-defined task."""
    result = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(...)
    return result
```

- Read the reference below for the exact signatures and exceptions.
- Prefer the highest-level function that does the job; drop to lower-level
  primitives only when you need the control.
- Keep `tempfile` calls behind a small function so the rest of your code does not
  depend on its details.

     |  )
     |
     |  Temporary file wrapper, specialized to switch from BytesIO
     |  or StringIO to a real file when it exceeds a certain size or
     |  when a fileno is needed.
     |

     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __del__(self)
     |      Called when the instance is about to be destroyed.
     |
     |  __enter__(self)
     |      # Context management protocol
     |
     |  __exit__(self, exc, value, tb)
     |
     |  __init__(
     |      self,
     |      max_size=0,
     |      mode='w+b',
     |      buffering=-1,
     |      encoding=None,
     |      newline=None,
     |      suffix=None,

     |      dir=None,
     |      *,
     |      errors=None
     |  )
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |
     |  __iter__(self)
     |      Implement iter(self).
     |
     |  close(self)
     |      Flush and close the IO object.
     |
     |      This method has no effect if the file is already closed.
     |
     |  detach(self)
     |
     |  fileno(self)
     |      Return underlying file descriptor if one exists.
     |
     |      Raise OSError if the IO object does not use a file descriptor.
     |
     |  flush(self)
     |      Flush write buffers, if applicable.
     |
     |      This is not implemented for read-only and non-blocking streams.
     |
     |  isatty(self)
     |      Return whether this is an 'interactive' stream.
     |
     |      Return False if it can't be determined.
     |
     |  read(self, *args)
     |
     |  read1(self, *args)
     |
     |  readable(self)
     |      Return whether object was opened for reading.
     |
     |      If False, read() will raise OSError.
     |
     |  readinto(self, b)
     |
     |  readinto1(self, b)
     |
     |  readline(self, *args)
     |      Read and return a line from the stream.
     |
     |      If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.
     |
     |      The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
     |      files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
     |      terminator(s) recognized.
     |
     |  readlines(self, *args)
     |      Return a list of lines from the stream.
     |
     |      hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more
     |      lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all
     |      lines so far exceeds hint.
     |
     |  rollover(self)
     |
     |  seek(self, *args)
     |      Change the stream position to the given byte offset.
     |
     |        offset
     |          The stream position, relative to 'whence'.
     |        whence
     |          The relative position to seek from.
     |
     |      The offset is interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.
     |      Values for whence are:
     |
     |      * os.SEEK_SET or 0 -- start of stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
     |      * os.SEEK_CUR or 1 -- current stream position; offset may be negative
     |      * os.SEEK_END or 2 -- end of stream; offset is usually negative
     |
     |      Return the new absolute position.
     |
     |  seekable(self)
     |      Return whether object supports random access.
     |
     |      If False, seek(), tell() and truncate() will raise OSError.
     |      This method may need to do a test seek().
     |
     |  tell(self)
     |      Return current stream position.
     |
     |  truncate(self, size=None)
     |      Truncate file to size bytes.
     |
     |      File pointer is left unchanged. Size defaults to the current IO position
     |      as reported by tell(). Return the new size.
     |
     |  writable(self)
     |      Return whether object was opened for writing.
     |
     |      If False, write() will raise OSError.
     |
     |  write(self, s)
     |
     |  writelines(self, iterable)
     |      Write a list of lines to stream.
