# Python: `secrets`

## Overview

Generate cryptographically strong pseudo-random numbers suitable for
managing secrets such as account authentication, tokens, and similar.

See PEP 506 for more information.
https://peps.python.org/pep-0506/

## When to use

Reach for `secrets` when your task calls for Generate cryptographically strong pseudo-random numbers suitable for managing secrets such as account authentication, to. It ships with Python — no dependency to install, available on every interpreter.

## Import

```python
import secrets
```

## Key functions

- `secrets.choice(seq)`
- `secrets.compare_digest(a, b, /)`
- `secrets.randbelow(exclusive_upper_bound)`
- `secrets.randbits(k)`
- `secrets.token_bytes(nbytes=None)`
- `secrets.token_hex(nbytes=None)`
- `secrets.token_urlsafe(nbytes=None)`

## Key classes

`SystemRandom`

## Constants / attributes

`DEFAULT_ENTROPY`

## Structuring it in a program

Import once at the top of the module, then call into it where you need it. A
robust pattern wraps the call, handles the errors the module can raise, and
keeps the interface small:

```python
import secrets

def do_work(...):
    """Use secrets to accomplish one well-defined task."""
    result = secrets.choice(...)
    return result
```

- Read the reference below for the exact signatures and exceptions.
- Prefer the highest-level function that does the job; drop to lower-level
  primitives only when you need the control.
- Keep `secrets` calls behind a small function so the rest of your code does not
  depend on its details.

CLASSES
    random.Random(_random.Random)
        random.SystemRandom

    class SystemRandom(Random)
     |  SystemRandom(x=None)
     |
     |  Alternate random number generator using sources provided
     |  by the operating system (such as /dev/urandom on Unix or
     |  CryptGenRandom on Windows).
     |
     |   Not available on all systems (see os.urandom() for details).
     |
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      SystemRandom
     |      Random
     |      _random.Random
     |      builtins.object
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  getrandbits(self, k)
     |      getrandbits(k) -> x.  Generates an int with k random bits.
     |
     |  getstate = _notimplemented(self, *args, **kwds)
     |
     |  randbytes(self, n)
     |      Generate n random bytes.
     |
     |  random(self)
     |      Get the next random number in the range 0.0 <= X < 1.0.
     |
     |  seed(self, *args, **kwds)
     |      Stub method.  Not used for a system random number generator.
     |
     |  setstate = _notimplemented(self, *args, **kwds)
     |
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Methods inherited from Random:
     |
     |  __getstate__(self)
     |      Helper for pickle.
     |
     |  __init__(self, x=None)
     |      Initialize an instance.
     |
     |      Optional argument x controls seeding, as for Random.seed().
     |
     |  __reduce__(self)
     |      Helper for pickle.
     |
     |  __setstate__(self, state)
     |
     |  betavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Beta distribution.
     |
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      Returned values range between 0 and 1.
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = alpha / (alpha + beta)
     |          Var[X] = alpha * beta / ((alpha + beta)**2 * (alpha + beta + 1))
     |
     |  binomialvariate(self, n=1, p=0.5)
     |      Binomial random variable.
     |
     |      Gives the number of successes for *n* independent trials
     |      with the probability of success in each trial being *p*:
     |
     |          sum(random() < p for i in range(n))
     |
     |      Returns an integer in the range:
     |
     |          0 <= X <= n
     |
     |      The integer is chosen with the probability:
     |
     |          P(X == k) = math.comb(n, k) * p ** k * (1 - p) ** (n - k)
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = n * p
     |          Var[X] = n * p * (1 - p)
     |
     |  choice(self, seq)
     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |
     |  choices(self, population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)
     |      Return a k sized list of population elements chosen with replacement.
     |
     |      If the relative weights or cumulative weights are not specified,
     |      the selections are made with equal probability.
     |
     |  expovariate(self, lambd=1.0)
     |      Exponential distribution.
     |
     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
     |      a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
     |      positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
     |      infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = 1 / lambd
     |          Var[X] = 1 / lambd ** 2
     |
     |  gammavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
     |
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |
     |      The probability distribution function is:
     |
     |                  x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
     |        pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
     |                    math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = alpha * beta
     |          Var[X] = alpha * beta ** 2
     |
     |  gauss(self, mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)
     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
     |      slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
     |
     |      Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
     |
     |  lognormvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Log normal distribution.
     |
     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
     |      normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
     |      mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
     |
     |  normalvariate(self, mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)
     |      Normal distribution.
     |
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
     |
     |  paretovariate(self, alpha)
     |      Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
     |
     |  randint(self, a, b)
     |      Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
     |
     |  randrange(self, start, stop=None, step=1)
     |      Choose a random item from 
```
