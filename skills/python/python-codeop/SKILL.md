# Python: `codeop`

## Overview

Utilities to compile possibly incomplete Python source code.

This module provides two interfaces, broadly similar to the builtin
function compile(), which take program text, a filename and a 'mode'
and:

- Return code object if the command is complete and valid
- Return None if the command is incomplete
- Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
  syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
  malformed literals).

The two interfaces are:

compile_command(source, filename, symbol):

    Compiles a single command in the manner described above.

CommandCompiler():

    Instances of this class have __call__ methods identical in
    signature to compile_command; the difference is that if the
    instance compiles program text containing a __future__ statement,
    the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts
    with the statement in force.

The module also provides another class:

Compile():

    Instances of this class act like the built-in function compile,
    but with 'memory' in the sense described above.

## When to use

Reach for `codeop` when your task calls for Utilities to compile possibly incomplete Python source code. It ships with Python — no dependency to install, available on every interpreter.

## Import

```python
import codeop
```

## Key functions

- `codeop.compile_command(source, filename='<input>', symbol='single', flags=0)`

## Key classes

`CommandCompiler`, `Compile`

## Constants / attributes

`PyCF_ALLOW_INCOMPLETE_INPUT`, `PyCF_DONT_IMPLY_DEDENT`, `PyCF_ONLY_AST`

## Structuring it in a program

Import once at the top of the module, then call into it where you need it. A
robust pattern wraps the call, handles the errors the module can raise, and
keeps the interface small:

```python
import codeop

def do_work(...):
    """Use codeop to accomplish one well-defined task."""
    result = codeop.compile_command(...)
    return result
```

- Read the reference below for the exact signatures and exceptions.
- Prefer the highest-level function that does the job; drop to lower-level
  primitives only when you need the control.
- Keep `codeop` calls behind a small function so the rest of your code does not
  depend on its details.

CLASSES

    class CommandCompiler(builtins.object)
     |  Instances of this class have __call__ methods identical in
     |  signature to compile_command; the difference is that if the
     |  instance compiles program text containing a __future__ statement,
     |  the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts
     |  with the statement in force.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __call__(self, source, filename='<input>', symbol='single')
     |      Compile a command and determine whether it is incomplete.
     |
     |      Arguments:
     |
     |      source -- the source string; may contain \n characters
     |      filename -- optional filename from which source was read;
     |                  default "<input>"
     |      symbol -- optional grammar start symbol; "single" (default) or
     |                "eval"
     |
     |      Return value / exceptions raised:
     |
     |      - Return a code object if the command is complete and valid
     |      - Return None if the command is incomplete
     |      - Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
     |        syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
     |        malformed literals).
     |
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

     |      list of weak references to the object

    class Compile(builtins.object)
     |  Instances of this class behave much like the built-in compile
     |  function, but if one is used to compile text containing a future
     |  statement, it "remembers" and compiles all subsequent program texts
     |  with the statement in force.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __call__(self, source, filename, symbol, flags=0, **kwargs)
     |      Call self as a function.
     |
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
