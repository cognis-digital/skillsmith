# Python: `struct`

## Overview

Functions to convert between Python values and C structs.
Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

The variable struct.error is an exception raised on errors.

## When to use

Reach for `struct` when your task calls for Functions to convert between Python values and C structs. It ships with Python — no dependency to install, available on every interpreter.

## Import

```python
import struct
```

## Key functions

- `struct.calcsize(format, /)`
- `struct.iter_unpack(format, buffer, /)`
- `struct.pack(...)`
- `struct.pack_into(...)`
- `struct.unpack(format, buffer, /)`
- `struct.unpack_from(format, /, buffer, offset=0)`

## Key classes

`Struct`, `error`

## Structuring it in a program

Import once at the top of the module, then call into it where you need it. A
robust pattern wraps the call, handles the errors the module can raise, and
keeps the interface small:

```python
import struct

def do_work(...):
    """Use struct to accomplish one well-defined task."""
    result = struct.calcsize(...)
    return result
```

- Read the reference below for the exact signatures and exceptions.
- Prefer the highest-level function that does the job; drop to lower-level
  primitives only when you need the control.
- Keep `struct` calls behind a small function so the rest of your code does not
  depend on its details.
