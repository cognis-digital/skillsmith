# Python: `time`

## Overview

This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.

There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
or a floating-point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
The epoch is the point where the time starts, the return value of time.gmtime(0).
It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.

The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (including century, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.

## When to use

Reach for `time` when your task calls for This module provides various functions to manipulate time values. It ships with Python — no dependency to install, available on every interpreter.

## Import

```python
import time
```

## Key functions

- `time.asctime(...)`
- `time.ctime(...)`
- `time.get_clock_info(...)`
- `time.gmtime(...)`
- `time.localtime(...)`
- `time.mktime(object, /)`
- `time.monotonic()`
- `time.monotonic_ns()`
- `time.perf_counter()`
- `time.perf_counter_ns()`
- `time.process_time()`
- `time.process_time_ns()`
- `time.sleep(object, /)`
- `time.strftime(...)`
- `time.strptime(...)`
- `time.thread_time()`
- `time.thread_time_ns()`
- `time.time()`
- `time.time_ns()`

## Key classes

`struct_time`

## Constants / attributes

`altzone`, `daylight`, `timezone`, `tzname`

## Structuring it in a program

Import once at the top of the module, then call into it where you need it. A
robust pattern wraps the call, handles the errors the module can raise, and
keeps the interface small:

```python
import time

def do_work(...):
    """Use time to accomplish one well-defined task."""
    result = time.asctime(...)
    return result
```

- Read the reference below for the exact signatures and exceptions.
- Prefer the highest-level function that does the job; drop to lower-level
  primitives only when you need the control.
- Keep `time` calls behind a small function so the rest of your code does not
  depend on its details.

DESCRIPTION
    There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
    of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
    or a floating-point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
    The epoch is the point where the time starts, the return value of time.gmtime(0).
    It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.

    The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
    The tuple items are:
      year (including century, e.g. 1998)
      month (1-12)
      day (1-31)

      seconds (0-59)
      weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
      Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
      DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
    If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
    if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
    if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.

FUNCTIONS
    asctime(...)
        asctime([tuple]) -> string

        Convert a time tuple to a string, e.g. 'Sat Jun 06 16:26:11 1998'.
        When the time tuple is not present, current time as returned by localtime()
        is used.

    ctime(...)
        ctime(seconds) -> string

        Convert a time in seconds since the Epoch to a string in local time.
        This is equivalent to asctime(localtime(seconds)). When the time tuple is
        not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.

    get_clock_info(...)
        get_clock_info(name: str) -> dict

        Get information of the specified clock.

    gmtime(...)
        gmtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday, tm_hour, tm_min,
                               tm_sec, tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_isdst)

        Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing UTC
