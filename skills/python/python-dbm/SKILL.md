# Python: `dbm`

## Overview

Generic interface to all dbm clones.

Use

        import dbm
        d = dbm.open(file, 'w', 0o666)

The returned object is a dbm.sqlite3, dbm.gnu, dbm.ndbm or dbm.dumb database object, dependent on the
type of database being opened (determined by the whichdb function) in the case
of an existing dbm. If the dbm does not exist and the create or new flag ('c'
or 'n') was specified, the dbm type will be determined by the availability of
the modules (tested in the above order).

It has the following interface (key and data are strings):

        d[key] = data   # store data at key (may override data at
                        # existing key)
        data = d[key]   # retrieve data at key (raise KeyError if no
                        # such key)
        del d[key]      # delete data stored at key (raises KeyError
                        # if no such key)
        flag = key in d # true if the key exists
        list = d.keys() # return a list of all existing keys (slow!)

Future versions may change the order in which implementations are
tested for existence, and add interfaces to other dbm-like
implementations.

## When to use

Reach for `dbm` when your task calls for Generic interface to all dbm clones. It ships with Python — no dependency to install, available on every interpreter.

## Import

```python
import dbm
```

## Key functions

- `dbm.open(file, flag='r', mode=438)`
- `dbm.whichdb(filename)`

## Constants / attributes

`error`, `ndbm`

## Structuring it in a program

Import once at the top of the module, then call into it where you need it. A
robust pattern wraps the call, handles the errors the module can raise, and
keeps the interface small:

```python
import dbm

def do_work(...):
    """Use dbm to accomplish one well-defined task."""
    result = dbm.open(...)
    return result
```

- Read the reference below for the exact signatures and exceptions.
- Prefer the highest-level function that does the job; drop to lower-level
  primitives only when you need the control.
- Keep `dbm` calls behind a small function so the rest of your code does not
  depend on its details.

DESCRIPTION
    Use

            import dbm
            d = dbm.open(file, 'w', 0o666)

    The returned object is a dbm.sqlite3, dbm.gnu, dbm.ndbm or dbm.dumb database object, dependent on the
    type of database being opened (determined by the whichdb function) in the case
    of an existing dbm. If the dbm does not exist and the create or new flag ('c'
    or 'n') was specified, the dbm type will be determined by the availability of

            data = d[key]   # retrieve data at key (raise KeyError if no
                            # such key)
            del d[key]      # delete data stored at key (raises KeyError
                            # if no such key)
            flag = key in d # true if the key exists
            list = d.keys() # return a list of all existing keys (slow!)

    Future versions may change the order in which implementations are
    tested for existence, and add interfaces to other dbm-like
    implementations.

PACKAGE CONTENTS
    dumb
    gnu
    ndbm
    sqlite3

FUNCTIONS
    open(file, flag='r', mode=438)
        Open or create database at path given by *file*.

        Optional argument *flag* can be 'r' (default) for read-only access, 'w'
        for read-write access of an existing database, 'c' for read-write access
        to a new or existing database, and 'n' for read-write access to a new
        database.

        Note: 'r' and 'w' fail if the database doesn't exist; 'c' creates it
        only if it doesn't exist; and 'n' always creates a new database.

    whichdb(filename)
        Guess which db package to use to open a db file.

        Return values:

        - None if the database file can't be read;
        - empty string if the file can be read but can't be recognized
        - the name of the dbm submodule (e.g. "ndbm" or "gnu") if recognized.

        Importing the given module may still fail, and opening the
        database using that module may still fail.

DATA
    __all__ = ['open', 'whichdb', 'error']
    error = (<class 'dbm.error'>, <class 'OSError'>)

FILE
    c:\python314\lib\dbm\__init__.py
